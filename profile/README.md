# The ALPS project
## Algorithms and Libraries for Physics Simulations

### Three tiers of ALPS

  1 Standard data formats and interfaces to facilitate
  - exchange, archiving and querying of simulation results
  - exchange of simulation and analysis tools

  2 Libraries
  - to support standard data formats and interfaces
  - to ease building of parallel simulation programs

  3 Applications
  - to be used also by non-experts
  - implement modern algorithms for a large class of models
